.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.BR dhcp-helper
is a DHCP and BOOTP relay agent. It listens for DHCP and BOOTP broadcasts on directly connected
subnets and relays them to DHCP or BOOTP servers elsewhere. It also relays replies from the remote
servers back to partially configured hosts. Once hosts are fully configured they can communicate
directly with their servers and no longer need the services of a relay.
